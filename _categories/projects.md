Technically this is an extension of experiences, but as someone who studied engineering my coding projects deserve their own section. Especially on my website! Since I am really a jack of all trades and have learned many different languages and had to study many different things the projects will probably reflect that. With posts in this section I will be aiming to show the initial idea, planning process, my implementations, the results and what I learned from the process. The destination does not matter here it is more about how many times I didn’t throw my laptop away.
