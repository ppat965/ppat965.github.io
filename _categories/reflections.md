Have you ever looked at something and thought I could write an essay about this? If yes, then you and I have something in common. This section focuses exactly on that feeling. Sometimes I am really inspired by a film, tv show, event or an album and thought I need to write about this. It is kind of like a review section as there will be some things I am more excited to write about then others. You may not agree with my takes but remember I cared enough to write, proof-read and convert my thoughts to markdown!
