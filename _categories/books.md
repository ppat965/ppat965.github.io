This section is probably my most dynamic one and is where I document what I have been reading and what my thoughts were on each book. My taste in books are very diverse I read anything between murder mysteries, romances, self-help books, fantasy, dystopia, business, biopics. Anything I am the mood in. I don’t rank the books or am going to rate them against each other because that is unfair. Each book I look for something different, and my thoughts will be related to that. This will be biased so don’t attack me!
