Experiences document the things I have been doing in my free time. From travelling, to baking or if I started a new hobby that I have always wanted to get into. I am a very hypercritical person who always thinks about what I can do better and so even if I am doing something again, I will be trying a different way and of course what I thought throughout the process. This is really energy dependent so I may not be doing anything.
