Hi, I’m Pooja, I recently completed a master’s in computer systems engineering. If you know me, you know I am not someone known to hold my tongue. When I have an opinion you will hear it. I am a bit of a rare breed: an engineer that actually enjoys writing. So naturally, when I wanted to create a website, I couldn’t just have a straightforward web portfolio, no. I needed to have it a blog as well. I wanted a space to explore both my creative and analytical sides. 

Thanks to GitHub pages and Jekyll I was able to combine both to have this website be part website portfolio and part creative journal. The blog focus on what I am reading, doing, making or coding, and inspired by. They will cover a wide range of topics, but I think what connects them is how I approach each thing with care, curiosity and overthinking!

 If that sounds interesting to you, have a look around. And if you want to reach out to me to agree, disagree or say hi you can find me on LinkedIn, email, GitHub, or even discord (@thewrongpooja)

Until next Time!
