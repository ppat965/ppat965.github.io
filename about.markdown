Hi, I am Pooja! I have currently finished my master's in computer systems engineering. When I was younger I believed I couldn't be an engineer because I did not think I am creative enough. Even after years in school I have to admit I am not a "yes and" person but am a "but how?". I don't think that is a bad thing per say as I believe that is also required for innovation.

I am someone who sometimes feel I am not equipped to be an engineer but with a lot of soul searching I think that it is not the case. Although I don't eat, breathe, sleep coding I felt creating a portfolio website just on my coding projects felt it didn't capture the essence of me. Which is why I created this website.

Website name is a hybrid between a web portfolio and creative journal. The website covers my varying interests such as what I am making, such as some random coding projects I have on the works, what I am experiences, which includes some of my travels anything cool I make or bake, what I am reading, which includes my thoughts on the books I am currently reading and a miscelleanous section on what I am currently inspired by. Just to cover something that moved me enough to write about such as a film, tv show, an event or music (stay tuned when the new Mariah Carey album drops).

If that sounds interesting to you have a look around, if you want to reach out to me such as to yell at me for being wrong! Feel free to do so through linkedin, github or discord (I am not on Twitter or whatever Elon calls it now).

Until next Time!
