  <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I am Pooja, a lover of all sweet things and a curious individual with very diverse interests. I like to do a lot of things and spend a lot of time in my head. This website combines both of those traits as I document what I have been doing, making, reading, or even watching and what my thoughts were about them a long the way. Feel free to have a look around and I hope at least something catches your eye!</p>
