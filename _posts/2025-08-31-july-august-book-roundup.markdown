sister wanted to go to Europe with me because we were both unemployed simultaneously, and she said If not now, then when? I was hesitant because I felt I should be trying to get back into job hunting. But I guess I wouldn’t have much holiday leave later on and would probably have more expenses to focus on. So, after the umpteenth rejection email, I decided to let's do it. We planned most of it beforehand in terms of places to visit. We are lucky to have family friends in Italy, so we could have a home base to ease into the time difference, because the first few days were rough. They lived in Vicenza, so we flew in and out of Venice. The next few blog posts will be about my travels.
